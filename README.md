**########## 3-Tier Architecture Tutorial #############**

Pre-requisites:
AWS account
Basic knowledge of AWS services like EC2, RDS, and VPC
Step 1: Set Up Your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Create a new VPC through the AWS Management Console.
Configure your VPC with a private and public subnet.
Create an Internet Gateway and associate it with the public subnet to allow internet access.
Step 2: Set Up the Database Layer
Launch an Amazon RDS instance for your database in the private subnet.
Configure the database security group to allow connections only from the application layer.
Step 3: Set Up the Application Layer
Launch EC2 instances in your public subnet for the application layer.
Install and configure your application software.
Ensure that the security group allows traffic from the Web layer and to the Database layer.
Step 4: Set Up the Web Layer
Launch EC2 instances in your public subnet for the web layer.
Install and configure your web server software.
Ensure the security group allows traffic from the internet and to the Application layer.
Step 5: Configure Security Groups and Network ACLs
Set up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
Configure Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
Step 6: Testing Your Setup
Access your web server through its public IP address or domain name.
Check the connectivity between the layers by trying to access the application and database layers from the web layer.
Step 7: Monitoring and Management
Utilize AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health and performance of your instances and database.
Set up alarms and notifications for any critical events.
Step 8: Backup and Recovery
Configure automated backups for your database using Amazon RDS snapshots.
Set up Amazon S3 to store backups of your application and web server data.


**###### 3-Tier Architecture Code #########**

Creating a 3-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform requires a good understanding of AWS services and Terraform itself. Below is a simplified example of how you might structure your Terraform configuration files to create a 3-tier architecture on AWS. In this example, weâ€™ll use EC2 instances for the web and application layers, and an RDS instance for the database layer.
